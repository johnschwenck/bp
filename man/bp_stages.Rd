\arguments{
\item{data}{User-supplied dataset containing blood pressure data. Must
contain data for Systolic blood pressure and Diastolic blood pressure at a
minimum.}

\item{sbp}{Required column name (character string) corresponding to Systolic Blood
Pressure (mmHg)}

\item{dbp}{Required column name (character string) corresponding to Diastolic Blood
Pressure (mmHg)}

\item{bp_type}{Required argument specifying which of the three BP data types
("HBPM", "ABPM", or "AP") the input data is. Default \code{bp_type} set to "HBPM".
This argument determines which processing steps are necessary to yield sensible
output.

HBPM - Home Blood Pressure Monitor | ABPM - Ambulatory Blood Pressure | AP - Arterial Pressure

NOTE: \code{bp_type} impacts blood pressure staging in \code{bp_stages} if \code{guidelines = "AHA"}, for which the
cutoffs for each blood pressure stage are automatically adjusted according to \code{bp_type}.}

\item{inc_low}{Optional logical argument dictating whether or not to include the "Low" category for BP
classification column (and the supplementary SBP/DBP Category columns). Default set to TRUE.}

\item{inc_crisis}{Optional logical argument dictating whether or not to include the "Crisis" category for BP
classification column (and the supplementary SBP/DBP Category columns). Default set to TRUE.}

\item{data_screen}{Optional logical argument; default set to TRUE. Screens for extreme values in the data
for both \code{SBP} and \code{DBP} according to Omboni, et al (1995) paper - Calculation of Trough:Peak
Ratio of Antihypertensive Treatment from Ambulatory Blood Pressure: Methodological Aspects}

\item{SUL}{Systolic Upper Limit (SUL). If \code{data_screen = TRUE}, then \code{SUL} sets the upper limit by which
to exclude any \code{SBP} values that exceed this threshold. The default is set to 240 per Omboni, et al (1995)
paper - Calculation of Trough:Peak Ratio of Antihypertensive Treatment from Ambulatory Blood Pressure:
Methodological Aspects}

\item{SLL}{Systolic Lower Limit (SLL). If \code{data_screen = TRUE}, then \code{SLL} sets the lower limit by which
to exclude any \code{SBP} values that fall below this threshold. The default is set to 50 per Omboni, et al (1995)
paper - Calculation of Trough:Peak Ratio of Antihypertensive Treatment from Ambulatory Blood Pressure:
Methodological Aspects}

\item{DUL}{Diastolic Upper Limit (DUL). If \code{data_screen = TRUE}, then \code{DUL} sets the upper limit by which
to exclude any \code{DBP} values that exceed this threshold. The default is set to 140 per Omboni, et al (1995)
paper - Calculation of Trough:Peak Ratio of Antihypertensive Treatment from Ambulatory Blood Pressure:
Methodological Aspects}

\item{DLL}{Diastolic Lower Limit (DLL). If \code{data_screen = TRUE}, then \code{DLL} sets the lower limit by which
to exclude any \code{DBP} values that fall below this threshold. The default is set to 40 per Omboni, et al (1995)
paper - Calculation of Trough:Peak Ratio of Antihypertensive Treatment from Ambulatory Blood Pressure:
Methodological Aspects}

\item{adj_sbp_dbp}{Logical indicator to dictate whether or not to run helper functions that adjust / process
SBP & DBP columns in supplied data set. Default set to: \code{adj_sbp_dbp = TRUE}}

\item{guidelines}{A string designation for the guidelines to follow when mapping BP
readings to a respective BP stage. \code{guidelines} can take on either "Lee_2020" corresponding to staging in Lee et al (2020), "AHA" corresponding to
guidelines by the American Heart Association, or "Custom" which utilize user-definted cutoffs in \code{bp_cutoffs}.}

\item{bp_cutoffs}{A list containing two vectors corresponding to SBP and DBP cutoffs, respectively.
The vectors both contain 5 integer values that each represent an upper limit cutoff for each SBP / DBP
stage. If \code{guidelines = "Lee_2020"}, this argument is ignored; if \code{guidelines = "AHA"} and
if the \code{bp_cutoffs} is manually adjusted (i.e. not the default list), then the manually adjusted
list will override the default AHA guidelines. The default AHA guidelines depend on the bp_type and will
adjust automatically based on the specification of \cde{bp_type}. If \code{guidelines = "Custom"},
the \code{bp_cutoffs} argument dictates the cutoffs for the respective stages as expected.

The SBP vector (100, 120, 130, 140, 180) corresponds to the upper limits for the following stages:
Low (0-100), Normal (100-120), Elevated (120-130), Stage 1 Hypertension (130-140), Stage 2 Hypertension
(140-180) according to the American Heart Association (AHA). When utilizing Lee et al (2020) guidelines,
the following additional stages will be automatically derived and included: Isolated Systolic Hypertension
for Stage 1 (ISH - S1) (130-140), Isolated Diastolic Hypertension for Stage 1 (IDH - S1) (0-130), ISH - S2
(140-180), and IDH - S2 (0-140).

The DBP vector (60, 80, 80, 90, 120) corresponds to the upper limits for the following stages:
Low (0-60), Normal (60-80), Elevated (0-80), Stage 1 Hypertension (80-90), Stage 2 Hypertension
(90-120) according to the American Heart Association (AHA). When utilizing Lee et al (2020) guidelines,
the following additional stages will be automatically derived and included: Isolated Systolic Hypertension
for Stage 1 (ISH - S1) (0-80), Isolated Diastolic Hypertension for Stage 1 (IDH - S1) (80-90), ISH - S2
(0-90), and IDH - S2 (90-120).

NOTE: The upper limit of the "Elevated" category repeats in the DBP vector and matches that of Normal.
This because according to most guidelines, there is no distinction between DBP cutoffs for Normal and
Elevated - these stages are discerned by SBP, not DBP. Should the user decide to manually change these
\code{bp_cutoffs} values, the stages will reflect accordingly.

Any manual adjustment to these SBP / DBP vectors by the user will be assumed to be "Custom" and will
classify readings accordingly. If no manual adjustments made, stage classification will conform to either
"Lee_2020" or "AHA" protocol (where Lee is pre-determined and AHA is determined by bp_type).

Any SBP reading below 100 or DBP reading below 60 is considered Hypotension ("Low").
Any SBP reading above 180 or DBP reading above 120 is considered a Crisis.

If \code{inc_low = FALSE}, although an upper limit value is still required in the SBP vector, the "Low"
stage will be omitted in the final output. Similarly, if \code{inc_crisis = FALSE}, then the "Crisis"
category will be omitted from the final output.}
