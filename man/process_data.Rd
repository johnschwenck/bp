\arguments{
\item{data}{User-supplied dataset containing blood pressure data. Must
contain data for Systolic blood pressure and Diastolic blood pressure at a
minimum.}

\item{bp_type}{Required argument specifying which of the three BP data types
("HBPM", "ABPM", or "AP") the input data is. Default \code{bp_type} set to "HBPM".
This argument determines which processing steps are necessary to yield sensible
output.

HBPM - Home Blood Pressure Monitor | ABPM - Ambulatory Blood Pressure | AP - Arterial Pressure

NOTE: \code{bp_type} impacts blood pressure staging in \code{bp_stages} if \code{guidelines = "AHA"}, for which the
cutoffs for each blood pressure stage are automatically adjusted according to \code{bp_type}.}

\item{guidelines}{A string designation for the guidelines to follow when mapping BP
readings to a respective BP stage. \code{guidelines} can take on either "Lee_2020" corresponding to staging in Lee et al (2020), "AHA" corresponding to
guidelines by the American Heart Association, see e.g. Muntner et al (2019), or "Custom" based on user-defined cutoffs in \code{bp_cutoffs}. By default, AHA guidelines adjust \code{bp_cutoffs} depending on the BP type.}

\item{bp_cutoffs}{A list containing two vectors corresponding to SBP and DBP cutoffs, respectively.
Each vector contains 5 values.

The SBP vector (100, 120, 130, 140, 180) corresponds to the upper limits for the following stages:
Low (0-100), Normal (100-120), Elevated (120-130), Stage 1 Hypertension (130-140), Stage 2 Hypertension
(140-180). When utilizing Lee et al (2020) guidelines,
additional stages are included: Isolated Systolic Hypertension
for Stage 1 (ISH - S1) (130-140), Isolated Diastolic Hypertension for Stage 1 (IDH - S1) (0-130), ISH - S2
(140-180), and IDH - S2 (0-140).

The DBP vector (60, 80, 80, 90, 120) corresponds to the upper limits for the following stages:
Low (0-60), Normal (60-80), Elevated (0-80), Stage 1 Hypertension (80-90), Stage 2 Hypertension
(90-120). The upper limit of the "Elevated" category repeats in the DBP vector and matches that of Normal.
This because according to most guidelines, there is no distinction between DBP cutoffs for Normal and
Elevated - these stages are discerned by SBP, not DBP. When utilizing Lee et al (2020) guidelines,
additional stages are included: Isolated Diastolic Hypertension
for Stage 1 (ISH - S1) (0-80), Isolated Diastolic Hypertension for Stage 1 (IDH - S1) (80-90), ISH - S2
(0-90), and IDH - S2 (90-120).

Any SBP reading below 100 or DBP reading below 60 is considered Hypotension ("Low").
Any SBP reading above 180 or DBP reading above 120 is considered a Crisis.

When \code{guidelines = "AHA"}, the cutoffs are automatically adjusted to match BP type without user input, For \code{bp_type = "hbpm"},
SBP = (100, 120, 130, 135, 160),  DBP = (60, 80, 80, 85, 110). For\code{bp_type = "abpm"}, SBP = (100, 115, 125, 130, 160), DBP = (60, 75, 75, 80, 105). An adjustment of default cutoffs by the user
These choices can be overwritten by directly changing \code{bp_cutoffs}, in which case the guidelines are ignored and automatically treated as "Custom".


If \code{inc_low = FALSE}, although an upper limit value is still required in the SBP vector, the "Low"
stage will be omitted in the final output. Similarly, if \code{inc_crisis = FALSE}, then the "Crisis"
category will be omitted from the final output.}

\item{ap}{(For AP data only) Required column name (character string) corresponding
to continuous Arterial Pressure (AP) (mmHg). Note that this is a required argument
so long as bp_type = "AP". Ensure that bp_type is set accordingly.}

\item{time_elap}{(For AP data only) Column name corresponding to the time elapsed
for the given AP waveform data.}

\item{sbp}{Required column name (character string) corresponding to Systolic Blood
Pressure (mmHg)}

\item{dbp}{Required column name (character string) corresponding to Diastolic Blood
Pressure (mmHg)}

\item{date_time}{Optional column name (character string) corresponding to Date/Time,
but HIGHLY recommended to supply if available.

For DATE-only columns (with no associated time), leave date_time = NULL. DATE-only
adjustments are automatic. Dates can be automatically calculated off DATE_TIME column
provided that it is called "DATE_TIME" exactly.}

\item{id}{Optional column name (character string) corresponding to subject ID. Typically
needed for data corresponding to more than one subject. For one-subject datasets, ID
will default to 1 (if ID column not found in dataset)}

\item{group}{Optional column name (character string) corresponding to an additional
grouping variable that can be used to further break down data. NOTE that this simply
sets the column as "GROUP" so that other functions recognize which column to use as
the grouping variable.}

\item{wake}{Optional column name (character string) corresponding to sleep status. A
WAKE value of 1 indicates that the subject is awake and 0 implies asleep.}

\item{visit}{Optional column name (character string) corresponding to Visit number}

\item{hr}{Optional column name (character string) corresponding to Heart Rate (bpm)}

\item{pp}{Optional column name (character string) corresponding to Pulse Pressure
(SBP - DBP). If not supplied, it will be calculated automatically.}

\item{map}{Optional column name (character string) corresponding to Mean Arterial
Pressure}

\item{rpp}{Optional column name (character string) corresponding to Rate Pulse
Pressure (SBP * HR). If not supplied, but HR column available, then
RPP will be calculated automatically.}

\item{DoW}{Optional column name (character string) corresponding to the Day of the Week.
If not supplied, but DATE or DATE_TIME columns available, then DoW will be created
automatically. DoW values must be abbreviated as such \code{c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")}}

\item{ToD_int}{Optional vector of length 4, acceptable values are from 0 to 23 in a an order corresponding to hour for Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night). This vector allows to override the default interval for the Time-of-Day periods: if NULL, the Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night periods are set at 6, 12, 18, 0 respectively,
where 0 corresponds to the 24th hour of the day (i.e. Midnight).
For example, ToD_int = c(5, 13, 18, 23) would correspond to a period for
Morning starting at 5:00 (until 13:00), Afternoon starting at 13:00 (until 18:00),
Evening starting at 18:00 (until 23:00), and Night starting at 23:00 (until 5:00)}

\item{eod}{Optional argument to adjust the delineation for the end of day (eod). The supplied value should be a character string with 4 characters representing the digits of 24-hour time, e.g. "1310" corresponds to 1:10pm. For individuals who
do not go to bed early or work night-shifts, this argument adjusts the \code{DATE} column so that the days change at specified time. \code{eod = "0000"} means no change. \code{eod = "1130"} will adjust the date of the readings up to 11:30am to the previous date. \code{eod = "1230"} will adjust the date of the readings after 12:30pm to the next date.}

\item{data_screen}{Optional logical argument; default set to TRUE. Screens for extreme values in the data
for both \code{SBP} and \code{DBP} according to Omboni, et al (1995) paper - Calculation of Trough:Peak
Ratio of Antihypertensive Treatment from Ambulatory Blood Pressure: Methodological Aspects}

\item{SUL}{Systolic Upper Limit (SUL). If \code{data_screen = TRUE}, then \code{SUL} sets the upper limit by which
to exclude any \code{SBP} values that exceed this threshold. The default is set to 240 per Omboni, et al (1995)
paper - Calculation of Trough:Peak Ratio of Antihypertensive Treatment from Ambulatory Blood Pressure:
Methodological Aspects}

\item{SLL}{Systolic Lower Limit (SLL). If \code{data_screen = TRUE}, then \code{SLL} sets the lower limit by which
to exclude any \code{SBP} values that fall below this threshold. The default is set to 50 per Omboni, et al (1995)
paper - Calculation of Trough:Peak Ratio of Antihypertensive Treatment from Ambulatory Blood Pressure:
Methodological Aspects}

\item{DUL}{Diastolic Upper Limit (DUL). If \code{data_screen = TRUE}, then \code{DUL} sets the upper limit by which
to exclude any \code{DBP} values that exceed this threshold. The default is set to 140 per Omboni, et al (1995)
paper - Calculation of Trough:Peak Ratio of Antihypertensive Treatment from Ambulatory Blood Pressure:
Methodological Aspects}

\item{DLL}{Diastolic Lower Limit (DLL). If \code{data_screen = TRUE}, then \code{DLL} sets the lower limit by which
to exclude any \code{DBP} values that fall below this threshold. The default is set to 40 per Omboni, et al (1995)
paper - Calculation of Trough:Peak Ratio of Antihypertensive Treatment from Ambulatory Blood Pressure:
Methodological Aspects}

\item{HRUL}{Heart Rate Upper Limit (HRUL). If \code{data_screen = TRUE}, then \code{HRUL} sets the upper limit
by which to exclude any \code{HR} values that exceed this threshold. The default is set to 220 per the upper limit
of the common max heart rate formula: 220 - age

see https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/measuring/heartrate.htm}

\item{HRLL}{Heart Rate Upper Limit (HRUL). If \code{data_screen = TRUE}, then \code{HRUL} sets the upper limit
by which to exclude any \code{HR} values that exceed this threshold. The default is set to 27 per Guinness
World Records - lowest heart rate (https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/lowest-heart-rate)}
