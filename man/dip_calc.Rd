\usage{
dip_calc(
  data,
  sleep_start_end = NULL,
  dip_thresh = 0.1,
  extreme_thresh = 0.2,
  inc_date = FALSE,
  subj = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{User-supplied data set that must contain \code{SBP}, \code{DBP}, and either \code{DATE_TIME} or \code{WAKE}
columns in order to distinguish between sleep and awake

In the event of non-ABPM data (i.e. a data set without a corresponding \code{WAKE} column), then a
\code{DATE_TIME} column \strong{must} be present in order to denote which times correspond to sleep and which
times correspond to awake.}

\item{sleep_start_end}{(optional) User-supplied manual override to adjust sleep interval indicating indicate start and end time
corresponding to the sleep interval of interest. Must only contain 2 values and must be 24-hour denoted integers

Example: \code{sleep_start_end = c(22,5)} indicates a sleep period from 10pm - 5am.

\strong{NOTE:} If the \code{sleep_start_end} function argument is specified, and no \code{WAKE} column
exists, then awake/asleep indicators will be assigned according the the \code{DATE_TIME}
column (which must exist). Otherwise, if \code{sleep_int} is not supplied, then the
WAKE column will default to a sleep period between 11PM - 6AM as specified in the
literature (see reference).

Furthermore, the \code{sleep_int} argument
will override the \code{WAKE} column, which may cause unintended consequences in the event that the
data set already contains a \code{WAKE} column.}

\item{dip_thresh}{Default threshold for normal "Dipping" set to 0.10 (i.e. 10\%). This value represents the maximum
percentage that BP can fall during sleep and be characterized as "Normal" nocturnal decline (dipping).
Specifically, this category includes all dips between 0\% and this value.}

\item{extreme_thresh}{Default threshold for "Extreme Dipping" set to 0.20 (i.e. 20\%). This value represents the maximum
percentage that BP can fall during sleep and be characterized as "Extreme" nocturnal decline (dipping).
Specifically, this category includes all dips between the Normal dipping threshold and this value.
NOTE: dip_thresh cannot exceed extreme_thresh.}

\item{inc_date}{Default to FALSE. Indicates whether or not to include the date in the grouping of
the final output}

\item{subj}{Optional argument. Allows the user to specify and subset specific subjects
from the \code{ID} column of the supplied data set. The \code{subj} argument can be a single
value or a vector of elements. The input type should be character, but the function will
comply with integers so long as they are all present in the \code{ID} column of the data.}
}
\value{
A list containing 2 tibble objects. The first tibble object lists grouped average values for SBP and DBP
for awake and asleep periods. The second \code{dip_pct} tibble object lists the dipping percentage and
classification according to the results from the first \code{dip} tibble. If inc_date = TRUE these two
tibbles will be broken down further by date. There are 4 classifications a subject can have (assuming a
default dipping threshold of 10\% and extreme dipping threshold of 20\% according to the original source):

\itemize{
   \item Reverse Dipper - no nocturnal decline (greater or equal to 0\%)
   \item Non-Dipper - a nocturnal decline between 0 - 10\%
   \item Dipper - a nocturnal decline between 10\% and the extreme dipping \% (20\%)
   \item Extreme Dipper - a nocturnal decline exceeding 20\%
}
}
\description{
Calculate the percent and average decline (or potentially reverse) in nocturnal blood pressure.
This function is typically used with ABPM data, or at minimum, data with a corresponding a
\code{WAKE} column available to indicate awake vs asleep.

Nocturnal blood pressure decline is an indicator of an individual's natural circadian rhythm. Studies
have shown that individuals with diminished circadian rhythms are more likely to exhibit target organ damage.
There is a "U-shaped" relationship that exists among the magnitude of nocturnal blood pressure decline; the
extreme dippers and the non-dippers (including reverse dippers) are both more prone to mortality risk than normal dippers.

NOTE: Any reference to "sleep" in the bp package refers to an individual's nocturnal period;
"sleep" is used in an informal sense for intuitive purposes. Technically, from a clinical perspective,
indication of sleep is currently obtained through means of EEG or other highly specialized equipment.
For all intents and purposes, sleep in the context of this package refers to actigraphy-inferred
nocturnal periods of rest.
