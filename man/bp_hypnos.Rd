\format{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{

\item{NR.}{Integer. The index corresponding to the reading of a particular subject for a given visit.}
\item{DATE.TIME}{Character. The date-time value corresponding to the given reading.}
\item{SYST}{Integer. The systolic blood pressure reading.}
\item{MAP}{Integer. The mean arterial pressure value.}
\item{DIAST}{Integer. The diastolic blood pressure reading.}
\item{HR}{Integer. The heart rate value (measured in beats per minute -- bpm).}
\item{PP}{Integer. The pulse pressure value calculated as the systolic value - the diastolic value.}
\item{RPP}{Integer. The rate pressure product calculated as the systolic reading multiplied by the heart rate value.}
\item{WAKE}{Integer. A logical indicator value corresponding to whether or not a subject is awake (\code{WAKE = 1}) or not.}
\item{ID}{Integer. A unique identifier for each subject.}
\item{VISIT}{Integer. A value associated with the visit number or a particular subject.}
\item{DATE}{Character. A date-valued column indicating the date of the given reading. Dates are specified according to their
